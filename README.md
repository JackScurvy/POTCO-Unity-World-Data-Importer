# 🏴‍☠️ POTCO Unity Tools

A collection of two Unity Editor tools designed for working with assets from *Pirates of the Caribbean Online*:

- 🗺️ **World Data Importer**
- 🛠️ **Procedural Cave Generator**

> Built using **Unity 6000.1.11f1**

> ⚠️ This project uses world data and phase files from a publicly available **Pirates Online Rewritten** GitHub repository.

---

## 📦 Model Conversion Pipeline

- Models converted from `.bam` to `.egg` using **Panda3D’s `bam2egg` tool**
- Imported into Blender using the **egg importer plugin**
- Exported as **FBX** files for Unity

> ✅ All LODs and collision data removed via `egg-trans` to focus purely on visuals.

---

## 🧭 World Data Importer

### 📌 How to Use

1. In Unity, click on the **`POTCO`** menu at the top.
2. Select **`World Data Importer`**.
3. Click **`Select World .py File`**, then choose a world file to import.

> ⏱️ *Importing the largest island, **Padres Del Fuego**, takes around 30 seconds. Most others are near-instant.*

### 🐞 World Data Importer Known Issues

- Some objects import at a slight, noticeable **inclination** (possibly due to nested parent-child transforms)
- **Alpha textures** do not render properly
- Some models (like islands) have **broken textures**
- Inconsistent **FBX scale and rotation**
- **Props with bones** are not supported

> 🔧 Importing is functional but not yet perfect.

## 🛠️ Procedural Cave Generator

### 📌 How to Use

1. In Unity, click on the **`POTCO`** menu at the top.
2. Select **`Procedural Cave Generator`**.
3. Configure your settings:

   - **Cave Length** – number of cave pieces to generate  
   - **Generation Delay** – controls how quickly each piece is spawned  
   - **Cap Open Ends** – automatically caps unconnected connectors with dead-end pieces  

4. Select which prefabs to include and assign their spawn weight.  
   > A **Padres-themed preset** is included for best results.

> ⚠️ Making cave pieces with 4 connectors too common may result in tangled or looping messes.

### 🐞 Procedural Generator Known Issues

- Caves might generate clipping over each other at times
